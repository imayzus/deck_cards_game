The project implements a deck of cards, with a set of required functions, such as draw a card, shuffle, and sort.
It contains a minimal simulation of a card game with two players drawing from a shuffled deck.

cards_game.py contains definitions of Deck and Card classes. The Deck class implements shuffle(), get_card(),
and sort() functions. Drawing a card from an empty deck results in IndexError exception.

Main available functions to run:

python cards_game.py
This will run play_game() that simulates the scenario of 2 players, drawing by turn 3 cards, with the winner
determined by the score of each player's cards. The score is calculated as the sum of suit point number * rank number

python test_cards_game.py
Run all available tests

test_cards_game.py includes the test for sorting a deck of
(Spades, 2), (Diamonds, 5), (Spades, King), (Hearts, 3), (Clubs, Ace)

into
(Spades, 2), (Spades, King), (Diamonds, 5), (Hearts, 3), (Clubs, Ace)
